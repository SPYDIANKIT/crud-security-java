  - `Task.java`: Represents a task entity.
  - `User.java`: Represents a user entity.
  
- **Repository**: Contains interfaces for interacting with the database.
  - `TaskRepository.java`: Interface for task-related database operations.
  - `UserRepository.java`: Interface for user-related database operations.
  
- **Service**: Contains interfaces and their implementations for business logic.
  - `TaskService.java` and `TaskServiceImpl.java`: Interface and its implementation for tasks-related operations.
  - `UserService.java` and `UserServiceImpl.java`: Interface and its implementation for user-related operations.
